# Shop-shop

### Description :page_with_curl:
In this module, you learned how to manage global state using React’s Context API. The Context API is quickly gaining traction as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to other libraries that manage global state in tandem with React, such as Flux or MobX. Nonetheless, the open-source JavaScript library Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application, and it’s very likely that you’ll encounter it on the job.

Your challenge this week is to refactor the e-commerce platform from the module project so that it uses Redux (Links to an external site.). You won’t need to make sweeping changes to the code, but you will need to read through the Redux documentation on your own to find the information you need. We’ve provided some guidelines to point you in the right direction in the Getting Started section below.

The project is deployed to [Heroku.]()
